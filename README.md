## Wrangle Dataset Project

### Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it; documenting my wrangling efforts. I showcased these efforts through thorough analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).

The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

### Project Steps Overview
Tasks in this project are as follows:
1. Gathering data
2. Assessing data
3. Cleaning data
4. Storing data
5. Analyzing, and visualizing data
6. Reporting 

### Project Goal
Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

This project is part of the series executed in my Udacity Data Analyst program
